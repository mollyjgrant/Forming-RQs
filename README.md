**PICOT Framework (from Thabane, 2009)**
The PICOT framework is helpful for structuring a specific and clear research question:

Element    	Description	                                                                              Example
P	          Population of Interest: Who is the target group you are studying?	                        Singapore children
I	          Intervention: What is the main action, treatment, or variable you're looking at?	        Effect of being obese (note: this element may not be relevant in predictive questions)
C	          Comparison: Are you comparing the intervention against a control group or usual care?	    Children who are not obese (note: this element may not be relevant in predictive questions)
O	          Outcome of Interest: What specifically do you want to measure?	                          Rate of poor mental health 
T	          Time Frame: Over what time period will your study take place?	                            At age 10.5 years

RQ: In Singaporean children, does being classified as obese, compared to those not obese, affect the rate of poor mental health at age 10.5 years?
